# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
We are working with Jill from Fast Lending a Peer-to-Peer lending services company who is looking to use machine learning to predict credit risk. To help understand credit risk in a credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, we will be looking at various algorithms in machine learning to help us predict the credit worthiness of individuals. We will be looking at 6 different models and will make a recommendation on weather they should be used by the bank to more accurtely and quickly predict credit worthiness individuals looking for credit.

We will now review the performance of each of the 6 different machine learning models we worked with.

### Cluster Centroids (undersampling)

## Summary
In conclution we would recommend using.
